Examination Project in Python

This is the advanced version of the examination project in Python for the "Introduction to Programming in Python and R for Biosciences" course.

Grade VG "passed with distinction" (highest possible grade).

The instructions can be found in the file "3FB221-final_hard.pdf". In this project we worked on finding mutation counts out of a sequence data file for multiple patients ("stu_08.dat").

No extra packages were allowed for this project (only base Python).
